### Problem Set 1: mario-less

## Establishing the Criteria
In a file called mario.c in a folder called mario-less, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:
```
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```
But prompt the user for an int for the pyramidâ€™s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:
```
  #
 ##
###
```
Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than 0 or not an int altogether.

## First, let's start with our libraries.
```
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
```
